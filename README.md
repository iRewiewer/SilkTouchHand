# SilkTouchHand
This plugin allows players to silk touch blocks with their bare hands. Those players can share their power with others. CONSOLE is blessed by default, start from there.

# Compatibility
Currently only supports 1.16.5

# Commands
/bless <player> - Bless another player with the power of the silk touch hands. Only works if you're blessed yourself.
/blessed - Check whether or not you've been blessed.

# TODO
Add some utility commands:
/removebless - Remove a player's blessing | Should only be available to operators & console.
/blessed <player> - Check whether or not a player is blessed.
/randombless - Bless a random player | Should only be available to operators & console.
Research how permissions work.
